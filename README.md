## Development of Efficient Algorithms

### Performing programming problems using efficient algorithms such as QuickSort and Binary Search.

- Within the realm of computer programming, competitive programming stands outâ€”a tournament where programmers solve problems efficiently within specified time and memory constraints. To compete in such tournaments, one must grasp programming fundamentals and understand various algorithms, considering factors like computational cost. 

<h3>
  This project aims to delve into competitive programming from a basic level, progressing through practice to solve a minimum of 50 different problems using the widely-used programming language
